## The Rant and Reasoning

This is intended to be _MY_ ideal emerald romhack for nuzlocking. I want to re-state again the keyword "MY", because it likely is much different than yours. Here's what I hate about nuzlocking various original games and even some romhacks, that I want to fix in my own crack at the perfect pokemon game:

- **The bridge between Theory and Execution (a.k.a the necessity of hacking)**. In many nuzlockes, the optimal way of playing is unfun. See examples below. I want the optimal way of playing to be fun, so for almost all of these examples I fix it by cheating in what I believe to be the solution (infinite rare candies, infinite full restores, setting friendship to max in PKHex, etc). I don't believe this is truly _cheating_ in the sense it is not allowing me to do something I couldn't do if I was 8 years old on summer break with infinite time. This respects my time while allowing me to focus on the skill-based aspects of team building and planning. **In this romhack, I intend to fix all of these with in-game mechanics so that the optimal way of playing this game is FUN**.
  - **friendship evolutions**. The optimal way is to ensure friendship evolution ASAP and for free by running back and forth for 20 minutes since every 100 steps increases your friendship by a point. This is unfun and boring, but is the best strategy.
  - **level grinding**. The optimal way to level up your team (EVs-excluded) is to go back to route 1 and endlessly grind risk-free on level 2 pokemon. This is boring, and prevents the player from playing optimally by introducing a psychological and time-based gate for not adding new party members (or creating new parties for specific fights).
  - **Berries (and other time based events)**. The optimal way to ensure you have enough oran/sitrus/lum berries for every fight is to always be planting berries and waiting days on end for the trees to regrow. C'mon.
  - **Finding and thiefing the correct items off wild pokemon**
  - **Visiting the pokemon center between every battle and encounter**
  - **Calculating IVs by keeping track of your EVs and making guesstimates using online calculators**
- **Trash Encounters**. Need I say more? Anyone who has played a nuzlocke of FireRed knows this. Half your encounters are trash or dupes. There's hardly any variety of pokemon.
- **Too Easy or Too Hard**. Original games are easy. Laughably easy. (This is by design since we beat them as 6 year olds). Even nuzlocking them doesn't present much of a challenge. My goal is a game that I can play through providing a good amount of challenge without having to uber-try-hard by calcing and spreadsheet every single battle in advance (_cough_ emerald kaiso _cough_). The difficulty I'm aiming for is slightly easier than Renegade Platinum (in my opinion the greatest enhancement romhack of all time).

Here's what I _Don't_ care about in Pokemon games at all:

- **Story**. Dude it's a Pokemon game. I don't care about the existing story, I don't want a new story or extensions to the existing one. Nobody's here for that. I want my nuzlockes to essentially be a dual-phase boss rush where you alternate between team building (catching new encounters on routes) and gym battles.
- **Intermediate Trainers**. I literally don't get the point of adding waves of cruft trainers you need to battle to progress (Rocket hideout in HG/SS I'm looking at you). I don't want to have to waste my time battling 26 grunts with underleveled zubats, grimers, and koffings. I don't want to have to dread every surfing route because of the hordes of staryu/horsea/seakings that I'll OHKO with a thunderbolt. Some trainers along the way in routes is fine, but once you express an idea, you don't need to bombard me with it.

So this romhack intends to be an enhancement hack (providing QOL features to fix above problems) and a difficulty hack (you can think of this like a boss-rush nuzlocke), that is intended to be hardcore nuzlocked (first encounter only, permadeath, set mode, no items in battles, level caps)
